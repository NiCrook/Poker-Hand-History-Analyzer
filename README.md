# Status
V1.01
Currently, this application has the ability to track basic information for the user, such as the number of hands played to the total results of all sessions played. More features are to arrive.
Next feature: better importing, from displaying contents of new imports to caching previous import data to prevent attempting to import already-imported data.

# Credits
Credits to everyone who built all the tools used here to allow me to build this, and to online poker.
